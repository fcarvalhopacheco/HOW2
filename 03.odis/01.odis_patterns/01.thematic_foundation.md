## JSON-LD Foundation

- JSON-LD is a data format that is used to represent structured-data on the web
  . It stands for `JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data` and is based on
  JSON format. 

- JSON-LD is designed to be machine-readble and to enable integration of 
  data from different sources. 

## The Context

The [`context`](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/foundation/foundation.html#the-context) 
from schema.org is a keyword that provides a way to define the vocabulary or 
set of terms that used in a JSON-LD document.

The schema.org vocabulary includes a wide range of types and properties that
can be used to describe different types of entities: `people`, `organizations`,
`events`, `products`, and others.

```json 
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "jobTitle": "Software Engineer",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "telephone": "+1-555-1234",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/john-smith",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Main St.",
    "addressLocality": "Anytown",
    "addressRegion": "CA",
    "postalCode": "12345",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  }
}
```

In this example, the `@context` keyword is used to define the schema.org
vocabulary, which is located at the URL https://schema.org/. The document
describes a person named John Smith who is a software engineer, has an email
address, telephone number, and a URL to his personal webpage. The address is
also included as a nested object using the PostalAddress type.

## Graph

[`Graph`](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/foundation/foundation.html#graph) is a
collection of nodes and edges that represent a structured dataset or a
knowledge graph. Each node in the graph represent an entity (person,
organization, event, concept ...) and each edge represents a relationship
between two nodes. 

`node`  = represent object or entities.

`edges` = represent the relationship between nodes. 

## Node Identifiers (@id)

[`@id`](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/foundation/foundation.html#node-identifiers-id)
is used to uniquely identify a node or object within a JSON-LD document. 

```json 
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "@id": "https://example.com/person/1234",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "jobTitle": "Software Engineer",
  "email": "john.smith@example.com"
}
```

In this example, the `@id` keyword is used to identify a Person object with the
URI https://example.com/person/1234. The `@type` keyword indicates that the
object is of type Person. The name, jobTitle, and email properties provide
information about the person.



## Type Identifiers (@type) 

[`@type`](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/foundation/foundation.html#type-identifiers-type)
is used to specify the type of entity being described. 

```json 
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "name": "Global temperature data",
  "description": "A dataset containing global temperature data from 1850 to present",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/global-temperature-data",
  "creator": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Climate Research Institute"
  },
  "datePublished": "2022-01-01",
  "variableMeasured": "Temperature",
  "measurementTechnique": "Satellite measurements",
  "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
}
```
In this example, the `@type` property is set to "Dataset" to indicate that the
content is a dataset. Other properties such as "name", "description", "url",
"creator", and "license" provide information about the dataset.

- In Schema.org and in most vocabularies, types will be named with a capitol
  letter.

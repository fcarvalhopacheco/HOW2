## Introduction

CreativeWork is a piece of creative content that can be represented online.
This includes various types of content, such as articles, books, music, videos,
and more. Within the CreativeWork category, there is a specific subcategory
called `Documents`. This category encompasses a variety of documents, such as
datasets, reports, and other types of documents.

`Datasets` are collections of related data that are structured in a specific way.
They may be used for various purposes, such as research, analysis, or modeling.
`Reports`, on the other hand, are documents that provide information on a
particular subject, often including data analysis and conclusions. Other types
of documents that may fall under the CreativeWorks/Documents category could
include whitepapers, technical specifications, and user manuals.

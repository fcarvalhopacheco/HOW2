## Introduction

`Experts` and `Institutions` are two types of entities that can be described
using schema.org vocabulary.

`Experts` = people or organizations who are considered authorities or
specialists in a particular filed or topic. They can be described using the 
`Person` or `Organization` `@type` in schema.org, and the `expertise` property
can be used to indicate the areas in which they are experts. 

`Institutions` = organizations or groups that have a particular function. 
They can be described using the `Organization` `@type` in schema.org 


## Example: [`Person`](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/thematics/expinst/README.html#example-person-graph)

The `knowsAbout` is a property that specifies what the person knows about. This
is an array of objects with their own properties. In this case, there are
three items in the array. One is a `Text` type that describes "Invasive species
in brackish water". Another is a `URL` type that links to an external resource
about Fiji, and the third is a `Course` type that describes a course that the
person has taken.

The `identifier` property specifies an identifier for the person, which is an 
ORCID identifier in this case. The identifier is described as a `PropertyValue`
, which includes a `propertyID` and a `URL`.

The `knowsLanguage` property specifies the languange that the person knows, 
which is `Spanish`. It is described as  a Language  type that includes the name 
of the language and its alternate name.

## Introduction

1. Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for managing IT
   infrastructure, deploying applications, and automating tasks. It allows
   users to manage multiple remote servers and automate tasks such as
   configuration management, application deployment, and task automation
   without the need for extensive programming skills.


2. You can use Ansible to replicate your computer to any other computer,
   provided that you have configured Ansible to manage your computer in the
   first place. To do this, you would first need to create an `Ansible
   playbook` that describes the configuration of your computer. This playbook
   would contain a set of tasks that install any necessary packages, configure
   any system settings,and copy any necessary files. Here is an example:

    ```yaml 
    - name: Configure my computer
      hosts: localhost
      become: true

      tasks:
        - name: Install necessary packages
          apt:
            name: [package1, package2, package3]
            state: present

        - name: Copy necessary files
          copy:
            src: /path/to/source/file
            dest: /path/to/destination/file
    ```

    > `apt` and `copy` are called `actions`
    > You can also set `pre_tasks`, include `vars` ...

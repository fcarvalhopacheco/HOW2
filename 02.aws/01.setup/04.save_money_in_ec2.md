## Tips: 

1. Use the right instance type: Always choose the right instance type for your
   workload. EC2 offers a wide range of instances optimized for different types
   of workloads such as compute, memory, storage, and network performance.

2. Use spot instances: Spot instances allow you to bid on unused EC2 instances,
   which can be significantly cheaper than on-demand instances. Spot instances
   are a great way to save money on workloads that are flexible about when they
   run.

3. Use reserved instances: Reserved instances are a commitment to using a
   particular instance type for a period of one to three years. By committing
   to use an instance type for a longer period, you can save up to 75% compared
   to on-demand pricing.

4. Use auto-scaling: Auto-scaling ensures that your EC2 instances are scaled up
   or down based on the workload demands. This means you only pay for what you
   need, which can result in significant cost savings.

5. Use cost explorer: AWS Cost Explorer allows you to visualize and analyze
   your EC2 costs over time. By analyzing your costs, you can identify areas
   where you can optimize your usage to save money.

6. Use billing alerts: Billing alerts allow you to set a budget and monitor
   your costs to ensure that you do not exceed your budget. You can set up
   alerts to notify you via email or SMS when you reach a certain threshold.


## How you can set up billing alerts:

1. Go to the [AWS Management Console](http://console.aws.amazon.com) and
   navigate to the billing dashboard.

2. Click on `Preferences` and then select `Billing preferences.`

3. Under `Billing alerts,` click on `Create a billing alert.`

4. Choose the metric you want to monitor, such as total costs, and set a
   threshold for the alert.

5. Select the notification method for the alert, such as email or SMS.

6. Click on `Create alert` to save your settings.


## How you can set up `CloudWatch` billing alarm:


- CloudWatch is another AWS service that can help you save money on EC2 by
  monitoring and optimizing resource usage. Here are some ways you can use
  CloudWatch to save money on EC2:


1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.

2. Go to the `CloudWatch` console by selecting `CloudWatch` from the list of
   services.
 
3. From the left-hand navigation pane, click on `Alarms.`

4. Click on the `Create Alarm` button to begin setting up your new billing alarm.

5. Choose the `Billing` option from the `Select metric` page and then select
   the `Total Estimated Charge` metric. Click on the `Next` button.

6. Select the appropriate billing metric that you want to track. You can select
   either `Dollars` or `Percentage.` Enter the threshold amount for the billing
   metric that you want to monitor.

7. Next, you need to set up the notification for your alarm. You can configure
   your alarm to send you an email, an SMS, or to run an Amazon SNS topic.
   Select the notification method that you prefer.

8. Add a name and description for your billing alarm.

9. Finally, click on the `Create Alarm` button to complete the process.

10. Once you have created your CloudWatch billing alarm, you can view and
    manage it from the CloudWatch Alarms dashboard. You can also modify or
    delete the alarm at any time. By setting up a CloudWatch billing alarm, you
    can monitor your AWS usage and be alerted when your spending exceeds a
    certain threshold, allowing you to take appropriate actions to reduce
    costs.

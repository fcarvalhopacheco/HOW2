- How to find and calculate the network address, first host, broadcast
  address, last host, and next subnet available for an IP address and subnet
  mask:

- For this example, we will use the IP address 192.168.1.100 and subnet mask
  255.255.255.0.

1. Convert the IP address and subnet mask to binary format:

   ```
   IP address: 11000000.10101000.00000001.01100100
   Subnet mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
   ```

2. Determine the prefix length of the subnet mask:

   - In this case, there are 24 network bits in the subnet mask, so the prefix
     length is /24.

3. Identify the network address by performing a bitwise AND operation between
   the IP address and subnet mask:

   ```
   IP address: 11000000.10101000.00000001.01100100
   Subnet mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
   Network addr: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
   ```

   The `network address` is 192.168.1.0.

4. Determine the broadcast address by flipping all the host bits in the subnet
   mask to 1s and performing a bitwise OR operation with the network address:

   ```
   Subnet mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
   Flipped mask: 00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111
   Network addr: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
   Broadcast addr:11000000.10101000.00000001.11111111
   ```

   The `broadcast address` is 192.168.1.255.

5. Determine the first host address by adding 1 to the network address:

   ```
   Network addr: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
   First host: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001
   ```

   The `first host` address is 192.168.1.1.

6. Determine the last host address by subtracting 1 from the broadcast address:

   ```
   Broadcast addr:11000000.10101000.00000001.11111111
   Last host: 11000000.10101000.00000001.11111110
   ```

   The `last host` address is 192.168.1.254.

7. Determine the next subnet available by adding the block size to the network address:

   ```
   Block size: 256 - 255.255.255.0 = 256
   Network addr: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
   Next subnet: 11000000.10101000.00000010.00000000
   ```

   The `next subnet` available is 192.168.2.0/24.
